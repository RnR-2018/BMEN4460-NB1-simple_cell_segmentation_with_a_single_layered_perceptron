# BMEN4460-NB1
## Simple Cell Segmentation with a Single Layered Perceptron.
Nanyan "Rosalie" Zhu and Chen "Raphael" Liu

This repository is a child repository of RnR-2018/Deep-learning-with-PyTorch-and-GCP. This serves a primary purpose of facilitating the course BMEN4460 instructed by Dr. Andrew Laine and Dr. Jia Guo at Columbia University. However, it can also be used as a general beginner-level tutorial to implementing deep learning algorithms with PyTorch on Google Cloud Platform.

This repository, Simple Cell Segmentation with a Single Layered Perceptron, is a super simple example of the least complicated neural network. For students in BMEN4460 (or who follow the instructions Step00 through Step02 in the parent repository), please create a Projects folder within your GCP VM and download this repository into that folder.

On the GCP VM Terminal:
```
cd /home/[username]/
mkdir Projects
cd Projects
git clone https://github.com/RnR-2018/BMEN4460-NB1-simple_cell_segmentation_with_a_single_layered_perceptron/
```

You shall then see the following hierarchy of files and folders, hopefully, which matches the hierarchy of the current repository.
